USING MULTIPLE CLASSES IN JAVA


Yes, it is true you could have multiple classes in a single java program.

To create a new class: 

go to project explorer
right click on source folder
select new
select java class
name it as mynewclass or any other name which you wish to
done!! your new class has been created
you could now create a new method inside your new class
now to use the method of your new class inside the old class, you need to create an object
of the new class in the old/previous class.



Wait!!!! what is object creation??

Whenever we try to use a method inside a class, we have to first create an object of the class.

This is how we create an object of a class

CLASSNAME OBJECTNAME= new CLASSNAME();
    
so this is the basic syntax of creating an object of a class
example: Lets say you have a class called as Student.
Now in order to create an object of that class we type

Student tom = new Student();

Here tom is the new object created for the class student.



METHODS WITH PARAMETERS

lets say you have a method which looks something like this:

public void displayMessage(){

    System.out.println("Hello");
}

Now lets say you want to pass a message i.e your own message to this method so that it could
display you message. In that case you could pass your message by using a parameter.

Now in order to pass in the message as a parameter to the above method we make some modifications to above code

public void displayMessage(String message){

    System.out.println("Hello");
}

as you could see, we have now added String message to the above code
this is called as passing a parameter, in this case we have passed a parameter which is message
which is of the type String to the method called display message.

Can we pass multiple parameters to a method??
Well, of course you can

Lets say you want to pass in two parameters to a method, in that case we modify the above
code as:

public void displayMessage(String message1,String message 2){

    System.out.println("Hello");
}

You could keep on adding as many parameters to a method as you want by simply using a comma.



USING MULTIPLE METHOD IN A SINGLE CLASS
You could also add multiple methods to a single class in java.

Example: Lets say you have a class called student.
You have a main method inside a class which looks something like this

public static void main(String args[])
{

}

And your entire code looks something like
class student{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {  }
}

Now you could go ahead and add in another method apart from the main method. lets say you want to add a new method called as print

so we go inside the class but outside the main method and type in

private static void print(){

}

so your entire code should look like
class student{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

    }

    private static void print()
    {

    }

}

So there you have it, multiple methods inside the same class. Also note that you could add as many methods as you want in a single class.

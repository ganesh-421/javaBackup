CALCULATING LENGTH OF THE STRING
So, how do we calculate the length of a string
Lets consider, you have a string which is declared as follows:

String message="Hello There";

Now to calculate the length of this string we simply use the method which is called as length
Hence first we type in the string name then give a '.' and after it type in length. This is how the code looks like:

message.lenght();
this line of code should return you the length of any string. now we need to store in this length in some variable so we type in the code as:

int a= message.length();

Now the actual length of the string gets stored in the variable a.



USING CONCAT TO JOIN TWO STRINGS


Lets say you have first name of a person in one string and last name in some other string.
Now you wish to join the first name and the last name together by using java code.
This is where the concat method comes in handy.
Concat method allows us to join two strings. Here is how the code looks like if you wish to join two strings called the first name and the last name.

String fullname= firstname.concat(lastname);
The above code should join the firstname and the lastname and store them into the String called as the fullname.
Simple enough!! Right?

Section 3, Lecture 14
Math Operations.


Performing mathematical operations:

To add two variables a and b: result= a+b; result is stored in variable result;

To subtract two variables a and b: result= a-b; result is stored in variable result;

To multiply two variables a and b: result= a*b; result is stored in variable result;

To divide two variables a and b: result= a%b; remainder is stored in variable result;



Increment and decrement operator in java:

Increment operator:

To increment the value of a variable by one we use the increment operator which is ++;

example: 

int a=10;

 a++;  

this line of code will increment the value of a by one

so the new value of a now becomes 11.



Decrement operator:

To decrement the value of a variable by one we use the increment operator which is ++;

example:

int a=10;

 a--;  

this line of code will decrement the value of a by one

so the new value of a now becomes 9.
